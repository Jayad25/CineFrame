## CraftStats

CraftStats will visualize the Employment rate for united states over the years. 

### Functionality & MVP
 In CraftStats, users will be able to:
- [ ] see different charts
- [ ] filter data between years

### Architecture and Technologies
  This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

  * Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure
  * D3 library to implement visual representation

  There will be two scripts involved in this project:

  * `d3.js`: this script will handle the logic for creating the necessary DOM elements.
