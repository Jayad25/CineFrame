## CineFrame

![Live_demo](https://jayad25.github.io/CineFrame/)

CineFrame will visualize the Movies between 2012 and 2016 based  on geners. User can click on each geners to list all movies. This list will user o visualize the data based on popularity(cicrle radius) and voting_Average(color)

### Functionality & MVP
 In CraftStats, users will be able to:
- [ ] see different charts
- [ ] filter data between years

### Architecture and Technologies
  This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

  * Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure
  * D3 library to implement visual representation

  There will be two scripts involved in this project:

  * `d3.js`: this script will handle the logic for creating the necessary DOM elements.
